I'm a final year graduate student in the MS/PhD programme at the [**UMass Computer Vision Lab**](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/). I am primarily advised by Prof. [Erik Learned-Miller](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/), and co-advised by Profs. [Liangliang Cao](http://llcao.net/) and [Subhransu Maji](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/).

My broad interests are in *label-efficient* approaches to learning, focusing on leveraging *contextual cues* such as temporal continuity in videos or object co-occurrences in scenes. I have worked on projects spanning <font color="DarkGreen">unsupervised domain adaptation</font>, <font color="DarkGreen">object detection</font>, <font color="DarkGreen">fine-grained recognition</font> and <font color="DarkGreen">face recognition</font>. Please check my [Publications](https://arunirc.github.io/publications/) page for more details on my research.

I maintain the website for [FDDB](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/) - a benchmark for detecting faces. I have been a reviewer for CVPR, ICCV, NIPS/NeurIPS and the journals TPAMI and CVIU. At UMass I help organize the [Machine Learning and Friends Lunch](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mlfriend/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) (MLFL) seminar series. Earlier, I was involved in [GRiD](http://gridclub.io/), a multidisciplinary graduate student organisation for data science.

I interned with NEC [Media Analytics Lab](http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/media-analytics/media-analytics-people) in San Jose over the summer of 2019, working with Xiang Yu, Kihyuk Sohn and Manmohan Chandraker. Earlier, I spent two happy summers in 2017 and 2014 interning at The Mathworks Inc. with the [Computer Vision Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html) team.

In the past I had worked on scene text detection and handwriting recognition at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](http://www.isical.ac.in/). My mentors there had been Profs [Ujjwal Bhattacharya](http://www.isical.ac.in/~ujjwal/) and [Swapan K Parui](http://www.isical.ac.in/~swapan/).
