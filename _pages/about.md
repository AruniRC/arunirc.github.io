I'm a fifth year graduate student in the MS/PhD programme at the School of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts. My research interests are in **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**, focusing on fine-grained recognition, face recognition and object detection. I am co-advised by Prof. [Erik Learned-Miller](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/) and Prof. [Subhransu Maji](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/) at the [UMass Vision Lab](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/). I have also worked with Prof. [Dan Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/) on an ecological computing project.

I maintain the website for [FDDB](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/) - a benchmark for detecting faces. I have been a reviewer for CVPR and the journals TPAMI and CVIU. At UMass I help organize the [Machine Learning and Friends Lunch](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mlfriend/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) (MLFL) seminar series. Earlier, I was involved in [GRiD](http://gridclub.io/), a multidisciplinary graduate student organisation for data science.

I have spent two happy summers in 2017 and 2014 interning at The Mathworks Inc. with the [Computer Vision Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html) team.

In the past I had worked on scene text detection and handwriting recognition at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](http://www.isical.ac.in/). My mentors there had been Profs [Ujjwal Bhattacharya](http://www.isical.ac.in/~ujjwal/) and [Swapan K Parui](http://www.isical.ac.in/~swapan/).
