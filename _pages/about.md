I'm a fourth year graduate student in the MS/PhD programme at the School of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts. My research interests are in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, focusing on face recognition and deep learning. I am co-advised by Prof. Erik Learned-Miller and Prof. Subhransu Maji at the UMass Vision Lab. I have worked with Prof. Dan Sheldon on an ecological computing project.

I also update and maintain the website for FDDB - a benchmark for detecting faces.

In the past I had worked on scene text detection and handwriting recognition at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My mentors there had been Profs U Bhattacharya and SK Parui.
