Our work on domain adapation of object detectors using unlabeled video is accepted at CVPR 2019. 
It provides a straight-forward way to adapt to novel domains with minimal dependence on hyper-parameters or a labeled validation set. 

A big shout-out to everyone who made this possible - Prithvijit, Ashish, Huaizu, SouYoung and of course our professors Liangliang and Erik.

Details and pre-print coming soon . . .
